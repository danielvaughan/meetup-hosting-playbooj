# Meetup Hosting Playbook
This is a playbook for anyone planning on hosting external Meetup-type events at their organisation's office. We use the phase Meetup as in [meetup.com](meetup.com) but this could apply to any community group.

## Assumptions
* The Meetup will be on a weekday evening.
* The Meetup will have up to 50 guests.

## Getting Ready

### Get a Sponsor
The easiser way to get started is to get an senior sponsor from your organisation. Having the backing of such as person makes your job a lot easier. If that person has an executive assistant that can help they are likely to be invaluable for navigating the organisation.

### People to Consult

To be able to plan the event you are likely to need to answer these questions.

##### Events

You may have an internal events team that organises company events. They may be able to help you by short-curring a lot of these questions.

##### Facilities

* What is the most suitable room/space for the event?
* What is the maximum number of participants the room can accomodate?
* How can the room be arranged e.g. for lectures, workshops or networking?
* Is there a health and safety breifing that vistor need to be given e.g. location of fire exits?
* Will there be any staff on site that can help during the event e.g.
* Is there a requirement to have a first aider available?
* What time do guests need to be out of the building by?

##### Security

* Do guests need to be registered in advance, if so what is the deadline for registrations?
* Do guests need to bring ID to get into the building?

##### Marketing

* Does any publicity need to be approved?

##### HR / Recruitment

Meetups are often useful for recruitment and publising open positions.

* Are there open positions that can be advertised at the event?

##### Technical / AV
